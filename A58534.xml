            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A REMONSTRANCE MADE TO THE <hi>PARLIAMENT,</hi> By the Kings Children, <hi>Sept.</hi> 30. 1642.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He High Court of Parliament having in all their Consultations endeavoured to effect those things that might redown to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Honour, and the good and welfare of His Majesties Royall Posterity, have not onely from time to time made many large professions and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball Declarations thereof, but have alwayes shewed themselves most loyall and faithfull subjects in ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and assiking his Majestie with their wise and faithfull Counsells and advice. And also by their large contributions towards his Majesties occasions, for Moneyes and other supply so farr forth as could possibly stand with the pronounsation of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties honour, and the peace and welfare of the whole
<pb facs="tcp:43774:3"/>Kingdome. And long since the unhappy difference (by the meanes of wicked Counsellors) did arise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his Majestie and his great Counsell of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they drew up a new Bill of tonnage and Poundage for three years which was passed by both Houses and presented to his Maiestie for his royall assent, but the said Bill doth still remaine with His Maiestie: His Maiestie refusing to passe the same, although his Maiestie received a great profit out of the last Bill, and so likewise is to receive out of this toward the maintenance of his Maiesties houshold, which benefit of late not being received, by reason the said Bill is not passed by his Maiestie; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance was drawn up and presented to both Houses of Parliament, by the Governours of the Kings Children at St. James house neere Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, setting forth that the allowance for their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance hath been detayned from them ever since the King refused to passe the Bill for tonnage and poundage, and desired that the Parliament would take it into consideration, and take a speedy course that some allowance might be allotted to be payed unto them towards their maintenance as formerly there was.</p>
            <p>Whereupon after some debate thereof in the Houses: It was agreed and so ordered that the grand Committee should take some speedy order for the payment of the said allowance, which they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the last day of Sep. last.</p>
            <p>The Parliament wisely taking into consideration what persons they are that have been the chiefe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries
<pb facs="tcp:43774:3"/>of stirring up and increasing the division between the King and the Parliament, and of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majestie to levy VVarre against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and all his good subjects, and so have thereby beene most apparently the occasion of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent distractions in the Kingdome, and of the great and vast expence of money in the Realme. The house having often shewed their desire to aid the King and to ease the subjects of the grievances, &amp; burdens, they have long laine under, whereby they would have made his Majesty the greatest Prince that ever sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Scepter in this Land, and settled the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in prosperity and tranquillity if he had had good Officers and faithfull Counsellors about him which had not drawne him from the faithfull advice of his great Counsell of Parliament. And finding that Papists and ill affected Protestants were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Instruments of these great evills that are in this Land. They have agreed that reparation shall be made unto the Kingdome for the great charge these Incendiaries of mischiefe have brought upon it, and would freely part with their estates to destroy the King and his good subiects.</p>
            <p>And therefore have ordered that no Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier shall plunder any Delinquents house, or the house of any persons ill affected to the Common-wealth, because they may be
<pb facs="tcp:43774:4"/>the better able to satisfie the Kingdom the great dammage it hath sustained.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is further ordered, that there shall be proclamation made in all parts of the Kingdom, for the summoning of the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> the Lord <hi>Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> his sonne, Sir <hi>Iervtce Scrorpe,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Munson,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Dallison,</hi> and all other Delinquents, which the Houses have drawn up any charge against to make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pcarance in Parliament by a day certain answer to their severall Impeachments, or that otherwise their Lands and estates to be seized upon and imployed for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like service of the Common-wealth, and and their persons to stand adjudged as guilty of Treason.</p>
            <p>And cartainly good cause have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to proceed in this manner, against such publike Enemies to the King and State; for if we search former presidents, we may find heavie Judgements and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, with losse of Lands, Tenements, Goods and Chattels, upon those that only
<pb facs="tcp:43774:4"/>for their own private lucre (not with an intent to overthrow the whole State) were means to impoverish the King, and deceive the Subject, as in <hi>Anno</hi> 50. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. where Articles were drawn up in Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Richard Lyons</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Merchant, the Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> which was Chamberlain, and one of the Kings Privie-Counsell, the Lord <hi>Nevill,</hi> and divers others, which Articles were of an inferiour nature to what are against these persons.</p>
            <p>The first being but for licence of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of Wools to other places then <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> for their private Commodity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they had procured money to be lent to the King by way of Usury, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had their part.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they had bought debts due by the King to common persons, for the ten 20. or hundred penny, and made the King pay them all.</p>
            <p>If the Parliament in those times bad power to proceed in this manner against those persons, what shall not the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:43774:5"/>do unto these Traiterous persons? And if the Parliament upon the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adam Burry</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> for some crimes by him committed, upon his not comming in upon summons awarded that all his goods and Chattels would be arest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, well may this Parliament doe the like unto a great number that have beene diverse times summoned to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for such crimes as are not to bee parralelled in all our Chronicles, and yet refuse to appeare to answer for the same.</p>
